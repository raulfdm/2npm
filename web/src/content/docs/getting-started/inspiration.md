description: What inspired this library

This project is an enhancement of [go-npm](), a project that attempts to solve this issue but which is no longer being maintained (last commit was 7 years ago) and doesn't cover the modern aspect of publishing a JS package, specially when it comes with the variarity of package managers (pnpm, bun, yarn, npm, deno, etc.).

So, I grasp the idea (which is totally correct) and cut some phases based on projects that do that like Biome<!-- Link to -->, SWC <!-- Link -->, Turbo <!-- Link -->.
